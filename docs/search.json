We will start promptly at 6pm, so please plan to arrive a bit early.\n\nYou are allowed one, single-sided 8.5x11 cheat sheet, either typed/printed OR written in pen.\n\nYou may write definition, theorems, properties, distributions, and other “factual” type of information. You are not allowed to write any worked out examples or problems.\nThe cheat sheet will be submitted alongside your midterm.\n\nBesides your cheat sheet, no other outside resources may be used. This includes a calculator.\nThe midterm will cover material through October 6 (through and including expectation and LOTUS).\nQuestions will be similar in conceptual difficulty to class activity problems and these practice problems. Solutions will be posted beginning of Week 5.\n\nIt is not my suggestion to only use these practice problems as your study guide. It would be good to skim through the readings from the previous weeks, return to homeworks, see the feedback Prof. Tang left on Canvas, etc."
