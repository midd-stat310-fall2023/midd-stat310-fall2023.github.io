## **Midterm 1**

Thursday, 10/12 from 6-8pm in LIB 201. We will start promptly at 6pm, so please plan to arrive a bit early.

-   You are allowed one, single-sided 8.5x11 cheat sheet, either typed/printed OR written in pen.

    -   You may write definitions, theorems, properties, distributions, and other "factual" type of information. You are not allowed to write any worked out examples or problems.

    -   The cheat sheet will be submitted alongside your midterm.

-   Besides your cheat sheet, no other outside resources may be used. This includes a calculator.

-   The midterm will cover material through October 6 (through and including expectation and LOTUS).

-   Questions will be similar in conceptual difficulty to class activity problems and these [practice problems](weeks/exam/midterm1_review.pdf). Solutions will be posted beginning of Week 5.

    -   It is not my suggestion to only use these practice problems as your study guide. It would be good to skim through the readings from the previous weeks, return to homeworks, see the feedback Prof. Tang left on Canvas, etc.

### Revisions

-   You may choose to revise one problem (for multi-part problems, "one problem" includes all the parts of the problem!)

-   **Bring to class Friday, 10/20/23:**

    -   **Original midterm (please do this regardless of if you are revising or not!)**

    -   An attached sheet that clearly denotes which problem you are revising, and:

        -   Your new solution to the problem

        -   What was not correct in your original solution

-   Please do not talk to others about your revision! You are welcome to come see Prof. Tang in office hours or schedule outside time to discuss the midterm.

-   Well done all!

## **Midterm 2** {#sec-midterm2}

Midterm 2 will feature both an in-person component and a take-home component. Some aspects of the take-home component will require `R`, whereas the in-person part will not.

Material through the end of Week 8 (up to and including MGFs) is fair game for this midterm. The exam will be lightly cumulative, but with emphasis on material covered since the first midterm.

I will host a review session on Sunday, 11/12 from 3-5pm in Warner 105!

More details and practice problems coming soon...

### **In-person component**

**6-8 pm on Thursday, 11/16/23 in Warner 104**

**Format and Resources**

-   You are allowed one, double-sided 8.5x11 cheat sheet.

    -   You may write definitions, theorems, properties, distributions, and other "factual" type of information. You are not allowed to write any worked out examples or problems.

    -   You *should* write down all of the PMFs/PDFs for the "common" distributions, along with expected values, variances, MGFs, and CDFs if we have learned them or seen them in the textbook

    -   The cheat sheet will be submitted alongside your midterm.

-   Questions on the in-class exam will be similar in difficulty and scope to questions from both Daily Assignments and Class Activities.

### **Take-home component**

**Available from 8:00am on Friday, 11/17/23 through 11:59pm on Sunday, 11/19/23.**

*We will not have class on Friday, 11/17/23.*

-   The take-home is assigned in such a way to give flexibility in travel and so you can fully enjoy your Thanksgiving break starting at 2pm on Friday (if you so choose). Therefore, I hope that some of you use the usual class time to work on the take-home.

**Format**

-   The take-home will be made available on Canvas. You will have \_\_\_\_ hours from opening the assignment to complete the take-home component of the midterm.
    -   It is your responsibility to make sure that everything is uploaded in time.
    -   Your solutions should be neatly written or typed. If you scan a handwritten assignment, be sure to review the legibility of your scan and upload before you submit your assignment.
-   Questions on the take-home exam will be similar in difficulty and scope to questions on homework.

**Resources**

-   You should e-mail Prof. Tang with clarifying questions only! I will do my best to answer within a few hours of you sending the email, but you should expect a longer wait if you send an email between the hours of 8pm and 8am.
-   You may use any notes you\'ve taken for this class, your work on any previous homework, in-class, and daily assignments, any solutions posted to the course Canvas site, comments you\'ve received on homework or assignments through Canvas, aand Blitzstein\'s textbook/videos.
-   You may not use any other resources other than those listed above. You may not seek answers to exam questions online or ChatGPT, or in other textbooks, and may not work with others on the exam.
