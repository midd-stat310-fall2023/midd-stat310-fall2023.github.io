## Midterm 1

Thursday, 10/12 from 6-8pm in LIB 201. We will start promptly at 6pm, so please plan to arrive a bit early.

-   You are allowed one, single-sided 8.5x11 cheat sheet, either typed/printed OR written in pen.

    -   You may write definition, theorems, properties, distributions, and other "factual" type of information. You are not allowed to write any worked out examples or problems.

    -   The cheat sheet will be submitted alongside your midterm.

-   Besides your cheat sheet, no other outside resources may be used. This includes a calculator.

-   The midterm will cover material through October 6 (through and including expectation and LOTUS).

-   Questions will be similar in conceptual difficulty to class activity problems.
